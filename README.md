## Implementation
I already know that is not completely BDD, but is using the gherkin syntax for this test.


## How to run
1. Go inside the folder "myproject" (at root level of pom.xml)
2. Run "mvn install"
3. Run "mvn test"
4. In the "target" folder you can find karate-reports to view the reports.
